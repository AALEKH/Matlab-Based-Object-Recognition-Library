         and few others that I might have not mentioned when I binded together the script following various examples several years ago (please *please* mention as an Issue if there is something that catches your attention that I should be in credits that I did not mention all those years ago). This I guess was kind of binding different script together (not sure what I was thinking) but credits for cars3.xml and other sources of script from which i learned how to use opencv with python 2.7 is missing. Plus I should have forked the script and not understand it line by line and then making something similar to the implementation. As of today I wasn't able to find source where I learned functioning of various script but I would be really grateful if the person reading this happen to find it, makes a PR for credit mentioning as it is going to be fair practise. Sorry for lack of ethical practise on my part.
